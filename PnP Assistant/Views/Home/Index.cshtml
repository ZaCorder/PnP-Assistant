            <h3>About PnP Assistant</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! Welcome to PnP Assistant.  This site provides some tools for gamers that want to play traditional
                pen and paper role playing games with friends via the internet.  Naturally there are some things that
                just don't translate well in an "online" setting compared to being in person.  Dice rolls can't be
                seen by the other players unless there is a webcam showing them.  This site implements dice rolling
                so that all players can see the results.  There is also a section for character sheets and notes!
                This will help DMs manage the smaller details for their NPCs as well as keep track of the characters
                controlled by players.
            </p>
            <h3>Common Questions</h3>
            <p>
                Is there a cost? No!</br>
                Why not use Roll20? This is simpler.</br>
                Do you plan to expand functionality?</br>
                Yes, eventually. For now this is just a school project.
